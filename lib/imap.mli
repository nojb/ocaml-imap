(** Non-blocking IMAP4 protocol codec.

    [Imap] is a non-blocking codec to encode and decode the full
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501}IMAP4} protocol, together with some
    {{!section:limitations}extensions}.  It can process input without blocking
    on IO and is completely independent of any particular buffering and/or IO
    strategry (concurrent, like {{:https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt}Lwt} or
    {{:https://github.com/janestreet/async}Async}, sequential, etc.).

    Most users should begin by looking at the {{!ex}examples}, the types and
    functions describing {{!type:connection}connections},
    {{!section:commands}commands}, and the {!run} function.

    See the {{!ex}examples} of use.

    is the responsability of the client to make any necessary validity check, as

    The following types describe the bodies of
    {{:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME}MIME} emails.  The IMAP server can
    parse the MIME structure of the messages and return individual parts.  This
    saves the client from having to do that parsing itself.  See

(** MIME content types

    The message MIME content type can be retrieved using {!fetch} with
    [`Body_structure].  Similarly, individual MIME parts can be retrieved using
    {!fetch} with an appropriate [`Body_section] message attribute.

    In IMAP, MIME media types are described as follows:

    - [`Text (s, f, n)] corresponds to the MIME type ["TEXT/" ^ s].  Common
      examples of the subtype [s] are ["HTML"] and ["PLAIN"].  [f] contains
      general part information (see {!fields}), and [n] is the number of text
      lines of the part.

    - [`Message (f, e, m, n)] corresponds to the MIME type ["MESSAGE/RFC822"],
      used to enclose a complete message within a message. [f] contains general
      part information (see {!fields}), [e] is the envelope information of the
      encapsulated message, [m] is the MIME structure of the encapsulated
      message, and [n] is the number of lines in the encapsulated message.

    - [`Basic (t, s, f)] corresponds to a (non-multipart) MIME type [t ^ "/" ^
      s].  Common examples of the type [t] are ["APPLICATION"], ["AUDIO"],
      ["IMAGE"], ["MESSAGE"], ["VIDEO"].  [f] contains general part information
      (see {!fields}).

    - [`Multipart (p, s)] corresponds to the MIME type ["MULTIPART/" ^ s].  [p]
      is the lists of MIME subparts. *)

    Status responses are [`Ok], [`No], [`Bad], [`Preauth] and [`Bye].  [`Ok],
    [`No], and [`Bad] can be tagged or untagged.  [`Preauth] and [`Bye] are
    always untagged.

    Status responses may include a "response code".  The response code contains
    additional information or status codes for client software beyond the [`Ok],
    [`No], [`Bad], and are defined when there is a specific action that a client
    can take based upon the additional information. *)

  | `Capability of capability list
  (** The list of capabilities supported by the server.  This can appear in the
      initial [`Ok] or [`Preauth] response to transmit an initial capabilities
      list.  This makes it unnecessary for a client to send a separate
      {!capability} command if it recognizes this response. *)

  | `Parse
  (** An error occurred in parsing the headers of a message in the mailbox. *)

  | `Permanent_flags of [ flag | `All ] list
  (** The list of flags the client can change permanently.  Any flags that are
      in the untagged [`Flags] {{!untagged}response}, but not in the
      [`Permanent_flags] list, can not be set permanently.  If the client
      attempts to {!store} a flag that is not in the [`Permanent_flags] list,
      the server will either ignore the change or store the state change for the
      remainder of the current session only.  The [`Permanent_flags] list can
      also include the special flag [`All], which indicates that it is possible
      to create new keywords by attempting to store those flags in the
      mailbox. *)

  | `Read_only
  (** The mailbox is selected read-only, or its access while selected has
      changed from read-write to read-only. *)

  | `Read_write
  (** The mailbox is selected read-write, or its access while selected has
      changed from read-only to read-write. *)

  | `Try_create
  (** An {!append} or {!copy} command is failing because the target mailbox does
      not exist (as opposed to some other reason).  This is a hint to the client
      that the operation can succeed if the mailbox is first created by the
      {!create} command. *)

  | `Uid_next of uint32
  (** The next unique identifier value.  Refer to {{:fdfads}???} for more

  (** Signals that the current mailbox has been closed.  It is sent when closing
      a mailbox implictly as a consequence of selecting a different mailbox.
      Requires [QRESYNC]. *)

  | `Highest_modseq of uint64
  (** The highest mod-sequence value of all messages in the mailbox.  Returned
      in an untagged [`Ok] {{!untagged}response} to the {!select} and
      {!examine} commands. *)

  | `No_modseq
  (** A server that doesn't support the persistent storage of mod-sequences for

      and the set of UIDs of the destination messages (in the same order).
      Requires [UIDPLUS].

      This response code is returned in a tagged [`Ok] response to the {!copy}

  | `Status of string * status_response list
  (** [STATUS] response: mailbox name, list of status items. *)

  | `Exists of int
  (** The [`Exists] response reports the number of messages in the mailbox.
      This response occurs as a result of a {!select} or {!examine} command, and
      if the size of the mailbox changes (e.g., new messages). *)

  | `Recent of int
  (** The [`Recent] response reports the number of messages with the [`Recent]
      flag set.  This response occurs as a result of a {!select} or {!examine}
      command, and if the size of the mailbox changes (e.g., new messages). *)

  | `Expunge of uint32
  (** The [`Expunge] response reports that the specified message sequence number
      has been permanently removed from the mailbox.  The message sequence
      number for each successive message in the mailbox is immediately
      decremented by 1, and this decrement is reflected in message sequence
      numbers in subsequent responses (including other untagged [`Expunge]
      responses).

      The [`Expunge] response also decrements the number of messages in the
      mailbox; it is not necessary to send an [`Exists] response with the new
      value.

      As a result of the immediate decrement rule, message sequence numbers that
      appear in a set of successive [`Expunge] responses depend upon whether the
      messages are removed starting from lower numbers to higher numbers, or
      from higher numbers to lower numbers.  For example, if the last 5 messages
      in a 9-message mailbox are expunged, a "lower to higher" server will send
      five untagged EXPUNGE responses for message sequence number 5, whereas a
      "higher to lower server" will send successive untagged [`Expunge]
      responses for message sequence numbers 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5. *)

(** {1 Authenticators}

    These are used to implement SASL authentication. SASL authentication is
    initiated by the {!authenticate} command and typically would occur right
    after receiving the server greeting.

    The authentication protocol exchange consists of a series of server
    challenges and client responses that are specific to the authentication
    mechanism.  If [a] is the authenticator being used, [a.step] will be called
    with each of the server's challenges.  The return value of [a.step] can
    signal an error or give the corresponding response.

    [step] functions do {e not} have to perform base64-encoding and decoding, as
    this is handled automatically by the library.

    The implementation of particular SASL authenticaton methods is outside the
    scope of this library and should be provided independently. Only [PLAIN] and
    [XOAUTH2] are provided as way of example. *)

(** {1:commands Commands}

    These are the available commands that can be sent to an IMAP server.  Not
    all commands will be supported in every IMAP server as they will depend on
    certain capabilities being enabled.  A command is executed using {!run}.
    It is a programmer error to try to run more than one command at the same
    time.  If this is required, more than one connection should be opened to the
    server.

    Some commands have a [?uid] optional argument.  When [true] it means to use
    the variant of the command that uses UIDs (instead of sequence numbers).
    See for example {!copy}, {!search}, {!fetch} and {!store_add_flags}. *)

val login: connection -> string -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [login user pass] identifies the client to the server and carries the
    plaintext password authenticating this [user] with password [pass].  A
    server MAY include a [`Capability] response {{!code}code} in the tagged
    [`Ok] response to a successful [login] command in order to send capabilities
    automatically. *)

val capability: connection -> response Lwt.t
(** [capability] returns the list of capabilities supported by the server.  The
    server must send a single untagged [`Capability] {{!untagged}response}
    with "IMAP4rev1" as one of the listed capabilities before the (tagged) [`Ok]
    response.  See the type describing the possible
    {{!capability}capabilities}. *)

val create: connection -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [create m] creates a mailbox named [m].  An [`Ok] response is returned only
    if a new mailbox with that name has been created.  It is an error to attempt
    to create "INBOX" or a mailbox with a name that refers to an existent mailbox.
    Any error in creation will return a tagged [`No] response. *)

val delete: connection -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [delete m] deletes a mailbox named [m].  An [`Ok] response is returned only
    if the mailbox with that name has been deleted.
    Any error in deletion will return a tagged [`No] response. *)

val rename: connection -> string -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [rename oldname newname] command changes the name of a mailbox from
    [oldname] to [newname].  A tagged [`Ok] response is returned only if the
    mailbox has been renamed.  It is an error to attempt to rename from a
    mailbox name that does not exist or to a mailbox name that already exists.
    Any error in renaming will return a tagged [`No] response. *)

val logout: connection -> response Lwt.t
(** [logout] gracefully terminates a session.  The server MUST send an untagged
    [`Bye] {{!untagged}response} before the (tagged) [`Ok] response. *)

val noop: connection -> response Lwt.t
(** [noop] does nothing.  Since any command can return a status update as
    untagged data, the [noop] command can be used as a periodic poll for new
    messages or message status updates during a period of inactivity (this is
    the preferred method to do this). *)

val subscribe: connection -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [subscribe m] adds the mailbox [m] to the server's set of "active" or
    "subscribed" mailboxes as returned by the {!lsub} command. *)

val unsubscribe: connection -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [unsubcribe m] removes the mailbox [m] from the server's set of "active" or
    "subscribed" mailboxes as returned by the {!lsub} command. *)

val list: connection -> ?ref:string -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [list ref m] returns a subset of names from the complete set of all names
    available to the client.  Zero or more untagged [`List]
    {{!untagged}replies} are returned, containing the name attributes,
    hierarchy delimiter.  The optional argument [ref] is the name of a mailbox
    or a level of mailbox hierarchy, and indicates the context in which the
    mailbox name is interpreted.*)

val lsub: connection -> ?ref:string -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [lsub ref m] is identical to {!list}, except that it returns a subset of
    names from the set of names that the user has declared as being "active" or
    "subscribed". *)

val status: connection -> string -> status_query list -> response Lwt.t
(** [status] requests {{!status_query}status information} of the indicated
    mailbox.  An untagged [`Status] {{!untagged}response} is returned with
    the requested information. *)

val copy: connection -> ?uid:bool -> eset -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [copy uid set m] copies the messages in [set] to the end of the specified
    mailbox [m].  [set] is understood as a set of message UIDs if [uid] is
    [true] (the default) or sequence numbers if [uid] is [false]. *)

val check: connection -> response Lwt.t
(** [check] requests a checkpoint of the currently selected mailbox.  A
    checkpoint refers to any implementation-dependent housekeeping associated
    with the mailbox. *)

val close: connection -> response Lwt.t
(** [close] permanently removes all messages that have the [`Deleted]
    {!flag} set from the currently selected mailbox, and returns to
    the authenticated state from the selected state. *)

val expunge: connection -> response Lwt.t
(** [expunge] permanently removes all messages that have the [`Deleted]
    {!flag} set from the currently selected mailbox.  Before
    returning an [`Ok] to the client, an untagged [`Expunge]
    {{!untagged}response} is sent for each message that is removed. *)

val search: connection -> ?uid:bool -> search_key -> response Lwt.t
(** [search uid sk] searches the mailbox for messages that match the given
    searching criteria.  If [uid] is [true] (the default), then the matching
    messages' unique identification numbers are returned.  Otherwise, their
    sequence numbers are.  The untagged [`Search] {{!untagged}response}
    from the server contains a listing of message numbers corresponding to those
    messages that match the searching criteria. *)

val select: connection -> ?condstore:bool -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [select condstore m] selects the mailbox [m] so that its messages can be
    accessed.  If [condstore] (default value [false]) is [true], then the server
    will return the [`Modseq] data item in all subsequent untagged [`Fetch]
    {{!untagged}responses}. *)

val examine: connection -> ?condstore:bool -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [examine condstore m] is identical to [select condstore m] and returns the
    same output; however, the selected mailbox is identified as read-only. *)

val append: connection -> string -> ?flags:flag list -> string -> response Lwt.t
(** [append m flags id data] appends [data] as a new message to the end of the
    mailbox [m].  This argument should be in the format of an [RFC-2822]
    message.

    If a flag list is specified, the flags should be set in the resulting
    message; otherwise, the flag list of the resulting message is set to empty
    by default.  In either case, the [`Recent] flag is also set. *)

(** {2 Fetch commands}

    The IMAP [FETCH] command is used to retrieve the data associated to a
    message (or a set of messages).  Messages are identified either by their
    sequence number (i.e., their position in the mailbox), or by their unique
    identification number (UID).

    For those servers that support the [CONDSTORE] extension, one can pass a
    mod-sequence value [?changed] to restrict the set of affected messages to
    those that are not yet known by the client.  One can further use the
    [?vanished] argument to learn of recently expunged messages.  It is a
    programmer error to set [?vanished] to [true] but not to pass a value for
    [?changed]. *)

val fetch: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?changed:uint64 -> ?vanished:bool -> eset -> fetch_query list -> response Lwt.t
(** [fetch uid changed vanished set att] retrieves data associated with the
    message set [set] in the current mailbox.  [set] is interpeted as being a
    set of UIDs or sequence numbers depending on whether [uid] is [true] (the
    default) or [false].  Specifying a [?changed] argument will further reduce
    the set of returned messages to those whose [CHANGEDSINCE] mod-sequence
    value is at least the passed value (requires the [CONDSTORE] extension).
    The [vanished] optional parameter specifies whether one wants to receive
    [`Vanished] responses as well. *)

val fetch_all: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?changed:uint64 -> ?vanished:bool -> eset -> response Lwt.t
(** [fetch_all uid changed vanished set] is equivalent to [fetch uid changed vanished set a], where
    [a = [`Flags; `Internal_date; `Rfc822_size; `Envelope]]. *)

val fetch_fast: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?changed:uint64 -> ?vanished:bool -> eset -> response Lwt.t
(** [fetch_fast uid changed vanished set] is equivalent to [fetch uid changed vanished set a], where
    [a = [`Flags; `Internal_date; `Rfc822_size]]. *)

val fetch_full: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?changed:uint64 -> ?vanished:bool -> eset -> response Lwt.t
(** [fetch_full u c v s] is equivalent to [fetch u c v s a] where
    [a = [`Flags; `Internal_date; `Rfc822_size; `Envelope; `Body]]. *)

(** {2 Store commands} *)

val store_add_flags: ?uid:bool -> ?silent:bool -> ?unchanged:uint64 -> eset -> flag list -> response Lwt.t
(** [store_add_flags uid silent unchanged set flags] adds flags [flags] to the
    message set [set].  [set] is interpreter as being a set of UIDs or sequence
    numbers depending on whether [uid] is [true] (the default) or [false].  The
    server will return the updated flags for the affected messages in untagged
    [`Fetch] {{!untagged}responses} depending on whether [silent] is [true] (the
    default) or [false].  Specifying a [?unchanged] argument will further reduce
    the set of affected messages to those whose [UNCHANGEDSINCE] mod-sequence
    value is at least the passed value (requires the [CONDSTORE] extension). *)

val store_set_flags: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?silent:bool -> ?unchanged:uint64 -> eset -> flag list -> response Lwt.t
(** [store_set_flags] is like {!store_add_flags} but replaces the set of flags
    instead of adding to it. *)

val store_remove_flags: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?silent:bool -> ?unchanged:uint64 -> eset -> flag list -> response Lwt.t
(** [store_remove_flags] is like {!store_add_flags} but removes flags instead of
    adding them. *)

val store_add_labels: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?silent:bool -> ?unchanged:uint64 -> eset -> string list -> response Lwt.t
(** [store_add_labels] is like {!store_add_flags} but adds
    {{:https://developers.google.com/gmail/imap_extensions}Gmail} {e labels}
    instead of regular flags. *)

val store_set_labels: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?silent:bool -> ?unchanged:uint64 -> eset -> string list -> response Lwt.t
(** [store_set_labels] is like {!store_add_labels} but replaces the set of
    labels instead of adding to it. *)

val store_remove_labels: connection -> ?uid:bool -> ?silent:bool -> ?unchanged:uint64 -> eset -> string list -> response Lwt.t
(** [store_remove_labels] is like {!store_add_labels} but removes labels instead
    of adding them. *)

val enable: connection -> capability list -> response Lwt.t

val authenticate: connection -> Auth.t -> response Lwt.t
(** [authenticate a] indicates a [SASL] authentication mechanism to the server.
    If the server supports the requested authentication mechanism, it performs
    an authentication protocol exchange to authenticate and identify the client.

    mechanisms. *)

(* val idle: connection -> command * (unit -> unit) *)
(** [idle ()] is a pair [(c, stop)].  [c] starts an IDLE command.  When this

    of can be stopped by the client by forcing [stop].  If [stop] is forced
    after [IDLE] ended, then it is a no-op.

(** {3 I/O interface}

    The following functions are used to provide input and/or output buffers to
    {!run} when it returns [`Await_src] and/or [`Await_dst]. *)

(** {3 Executing commands}

    The {!run} function encodes the connection state machine.  A connection [c]
    can be in three states: {e awaiting the server greeting}, {e executing a
    command}, or {e awaiting commands}.

    After {{!val:connection}creation}, [c] is {e awaiting the server greeting.}
    {!run} must be passed [`Await] until getting back [`Ok] which signals that
    the greeting has been received and [c] is now {e awaiting commands.}  A
    command can then be initiated by passing [`Cmd].  After a command is
    initiated, [c] will be {e executing a command} and {!run} will return a
    sequence of [`Await_src] and/or [`Await_dst] values interspaced with
    [`Untagged] values, and finally ending with [`Ok].  The client should call
    {!run} with [`Await] to step through this process (possibly after providing
    more input and output storage using {!src} and {!dst}).

    After returning [`Ok], [c] is again {e awaiting commands} and the process can be
    reinitiated.

    It is an error to execute a command if [c] is not {e awaiting commands.}

    See the {{!ex}examples.} *)

    [host] on port [port] over {{:https://github.com/savonet/ocaml-ssl}SSL},
    authenticates user [user] with password [pass] and watches mailbox [mbox] until a
    new message arrives.  When a new message arrives, it outputs the sender's name
    and address and stops.

    See the
    {{:https://github.com/nojb/ocaml-imap/blob/master/test/wait_mail.ml}wait_mail.ml}
    file for a more complete version of this example.
